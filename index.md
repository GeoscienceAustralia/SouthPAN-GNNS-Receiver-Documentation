## SouthPAN Early Open Services

SouthPAN augments satellite positioning services to provide improved Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) capabilities for End-Users in Australia and New Zealand. These capabilities are be made available to End-Users through their GNSS-enabled devices and dedicated internet services.

The SouthPAN Early Open Services include:

1. **L1 SBAS** providing augmentation of the GPS L1 C/A, delivered on the L1 frequency
2. **DFMC SBAS** providing augmentation of the GPS L1 C/A, GPS L5, Galileo E1, and Galileo E5a signals, delivered on the L5 frequency
3. **PPP via SouthPAN (PVS)** providing augmentation of the GPS L1 C/A, GPS L5, Galileo E1, and Galileo E5a signals, delivered on the L5 frequency

SouthPAN Early Open Services are available now via navigation Signals-In-Space and will eventually be provided the over the internet. These services are provided to non-Safety-of-Life users as the infrastructure for the Safety-of-Life Service is deployed and certified. Service performance will improve progressively as infrastructure upgrades are deployed, offering greater resilience, reliability and redundancy.

GNSS equipment manufacturers, applications developers, and end-users should use the SouthPAN Service Definition Document and Disclaimer to implement the early Open Services from SouthPAN on their devices:
